				<h2>Photography; Nature &amp; Nurture</h2>
					<p>Jaquesea has held a passion for gardening since childhood.  The peace it brings to play in the</br>
					soil is priceless, and a little later beautiful blossoms appear.  That's when the camera comes out.</br>
					All of the earth's elements play apart; the seasons, the clouds, the sun, and wind.  Did it rain?</br>
					Are there dew drops? I'm as excited as a child might be taking in something amazing for the first time.</br>
					It may be as simple as a frog hopping into your path. Photography preserves mindfulness of ones surrounding</br>
					and it's power.</p>

  					<h3>Your First Garden</h3>
					<p> Should it be vegetable, flowers or both.</p>
				</header>
					<p>The most beautiful and productive gardens take planning.  How much space do I have?</br>
					Should I plant veggies, shrubberies, flowers?  Take a walk around the area you would like</br>
					to plant and then sit down with a pencil and paper.  Sketch out your area first.  How would</br>
					you like to edge it? They are many ways to edge a garden; rubber strip, brick or pressure</br>
					treated lumber are a few options.</p>
					<p>Bring in some gardening soil to an equal part of dehydrated cow manure.  Then add enough</br>
					peet moss to fluff the soil up a bit.</p>
					<p>If planting flowers, do some research about perennials and annuals.  What zone do they grow</br>
					best in?  Planting zone map can be found online.  Do the plants need sun or shade?  If flowers,</br>
					what time of year do they blossom and for how long?  Will they be tall or low to the grown?</br>
					Knowing this will allow you to plant in a way to not block your view of different plants</br>
					as they bloom.</p>
					<p>Vegetable may vine and need support trellises. Tomato cages may be purchased or build.</p>
					<p>A well thought plan will produce a pleasurable viewing with bountiful results. So joyfully reap</br>
					what you so.</p>
